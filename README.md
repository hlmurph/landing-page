This is my second project in pursuit of completing The Odin Project. It is a demonstration of flexbox, and the first time I have maintained a project through github, and even changed branches once! The subject material is from a drift trike that I build with some friends during the covid pandemic.

I learned a ton about css and flexbox with this project, tip toeing closer and closer to having something resembling understanding. Thank you for reading!
